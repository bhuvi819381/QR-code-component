## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- For me it was very dificult to choose the right properties in css to get the body and the .container to work and be seen as the style guide declared.

- At the end, i believe i did a good job with the things that i used. Always open to any comments

### Continued development

- i'll learn more and continue improve 

### Useful resources

- [FLEXBOX FROGGY](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) - This helped me to understand better how to use flexbox.
